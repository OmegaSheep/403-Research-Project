#TODO LIST

#skipSearch should return a pointer to the selected item.

#insert should use the pointer provided by skipSearch.

#Add a delete function.

#Make the integer component anything with a < than operator? (See C++ templates, should work with structs.)

#Try storing the index of each node so that the list can be indexed. (ie. get the Kth item)

#Compare performance to a C++ set?

#Documentation and test cases.
